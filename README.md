# generator-posw [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/skip405/generator-posw.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skip405/generator-posw)

POSW stands for **P**lain **O**ld **S**emantic **W**ebsite. It's an opinionated [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator that will help you code a static website from design mockups.

## Features

POSW comes with a bunch of stuff. It allows you to code either in PHP or HTML. It uses Sass as a CSS preprocessor. The ``styles`` folder structure is made with BEM in mind. 


## Getting Started

First you need to install Yeoman:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

Then you need to install generator-posw from npm:

```bash
npm install -g generator-posw
```

Create a directory for your project and ``cd`` into it.

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo posw
```

### Getting To Know POSW

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
